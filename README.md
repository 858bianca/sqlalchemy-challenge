# sqlalchemy

In this module, it focuses on building a Flask API to analyze the climate for Honolulu, Hawaii. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and SQLite, it demonstrates skills and proficiency in database management, querying, and API design while integrating data analysis workflows.

Analysis:

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database provided to me. By using these tools SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I was able to connect my engine to my SQLite database, reflect my tables into classes, and save the references, and lastly link my Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session. 

Next, I ran a precipitation and station analysis. This help visulaly aid precipitation levels, and most active stations throughout a given time period. 

To finish off, I created my own climate app. I used Flask API to help me develop my routes for precipitation, active stations, and temperature observation in most active station.
